# Twitter Data Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sentiment in Twitter data to understand public opinion on various topics. It involves collecting tweets, preprocessing text data, applying machine learning models for sentiment classification, and visualizing sentiment trends.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of tweets collected from Twitter's API, including attributes such as:
- Tweet text
- User information
- Timestamps
- Retweets and likes
- Sentiment labels (if labeled)

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Using Twitter API to gather tweets based on search queries or streaming real-time data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning text data (removing special characters, stopwords, etc.).
   - Tokenization and normalization (lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization).

3. **Sentiment Classification**:
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM) for sentiment analysis.
   - Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plotting sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Time series analysis of sentiment trends over specific periods.

## Machine Learning Models

Several models are applied to classify sentiment in tweets:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Other deep learning models (optional)

### Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using cross-validation and test set performance metrics.
